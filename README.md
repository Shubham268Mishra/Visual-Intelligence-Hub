# Visual-Intelligence-Hub
Welcome to the Visual Intelligence Hub repository! This repository serves as a central hub for various projects related to visual intelligence, including facial recognition, digit recognition, and other image processing tasks.

## Introduction
Visual intelligence refers to the ability of machines to interpret and understand visual information, often using techniques from computer vision and machine learning. The projects in this repository leverage state-of-the-art algorithms and datasets to address real-world problems related to image analysis, classification, and recognition.

## Projects
1. Facial Recognition
The facial recognition project utilizes deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques to recognize faces in images. It includes preprocessing steps, feature extraction, and classification using algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

2. Digit Recognition
The digit recognition project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits in images. It involves preprocessing steps, dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and classification using algorithms such as Naive Bayes or k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
